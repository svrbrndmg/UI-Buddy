#It's very fragile trust me. Anyways, not much to explain here, even,
#as I don't understand much of it tbh. Ya make a button with tk.Button,
#specify some parameters (usually in the code, but this is UI-Buddy, where
#you get to choose your own adventure!! HELL YEAH BROTHER!!!)
#and uhhh, yeah, there's an else statement in case the user enters in bad data.
#DON'T ENTER COLORS IN WHEN IT ASKS YOU FOR A BORDER SIZE, KIDS!
#THAT'S ALL FOLKS!
