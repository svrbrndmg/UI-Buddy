# UI-Buddy
A simple python program that creates a "UI" window with buttons and the like per the user's custom requests. 
Very simple as of now, and only interactable through text. Major features are being worked on by me.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-==============-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You have just downloaded UI-Buddy v0.3, the newest (and first) major coding project from me.
The program is not as advanced as I want it to be (yet) and god knows, I'm a bad programmer,
but I hope you'll enjoy using UI-Buddy! Here's the tech support FAQ:

Q: Why can't I set my own background/icon, Python keeps saying it's not defined?
A: Python (at least the interpreter) hates spaces, dashes and some other stuff because of Unicode (of course),
so as of right now, I would say put your background/icon in a directory with none of these symbols in the name,
and rename the file itself too. Sorry! I'll try to do something about it in 0.3 but no promises! :(
Q: The custom background I chose doesn't fit the whole window. What do?
A: If you want the image to cover the window, make the window size the same as the image size.
Like, for example, a 640x480 image needs a 640x480 window.
Q: The custom icon I chose doesn't seem to work. What do?
A: It is likely due to the icon being small and/or not being in .ico format.
The icons that are provided by me should work, but I can't guarantee custom ones will.
Remember! 24x24, and use cloudconvert to convert it into a .ico!


History:

pre-classic:
-very basic
-before saving/loading

classic:
-back when saving/loading existed, though it was just the saving part
-still usable but not as customizable

0.1:
(retroactive name) THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM UPDATE!
-added window name customization
-added comments so you can understand my scrawlings (more to come)
-added one more button option, bringing it to 3

smaller changes:
-fixed a problem where only one button would show up even if user chose 2 buttons

0.2:
(retroactive name) THE BIG UPDATE!
-seperated button contents. For now it's only text. You can have different text on buttons now!
-added one of the button slots (you can now have 4 buttons at once!)
-added reset question at the end; reset or quit
-added the ability to change the icon of the window (only 24x24 for now! use a converter if you have to)
-buttons are aligned horizontally now instead of vertically

smaller changes:
-made ui-buddy more accessible
-added more comments
-fixed an issue where the program would close if you entered bad data at any point then proceeded to the end. Now it waits, then restarts.
-added a really bad default icon in case you don't wanna upload your own (I will make it better i promise ;-;) along with 2 test icons in the zip.
-miscellanous changes and additions for a better experience ;)

0.3:
THE CUSTOMIZATION UPDATE!
-buttons can now either print whatever you want or open links!
-added customizable button state, background and window size!
-added another button slot (you can have 5 now!)
-added splash screen text (8 possible lines to get!)

smaller changes:
-ui buddy releases are now in form of .zips, including all your favourite test icons! lol
-there is a default image background included in every release from now on if you want to test it :3 It's 262x257.
-squashed some bugs along the way
-added more comments, and updated some un-family-friendly comments to be family-friendly in case anyone needs that

removals:
-reset question removed. I simply had to, it wasn't working for everyone. Expect to see it in a future update! (hopefully)
